# **Email Validator.dart** 

A simple Dart class for validating email addresses without using RegEx. Can also be used to validate emails within Flutter apps (see [Flutter email validation](https://github.com/fredeil/flutter-email-validator)).


**NB:** This library only validates the syntax of the email, not by looking up domain or whether an email actually exists.
